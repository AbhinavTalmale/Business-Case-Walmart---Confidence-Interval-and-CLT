### Insights: 
-   **Analyzed** Walmart's Black Friday transactional dataset using Python libraries and statistical methods to identify key factors influencing customer purchase behavior and assess gender-based spending differences.
-   **Highlighted** that male customers have higher spending per transaction, with a 90% confidence level showing their purchase amounts range between $9,436 and $9,440, compared to $8,733 to $8,736 for female customers.
    
-   **Demonstrated** that even at a 95% confidence level, male customers consistently spend more, confirming the trend of higher average expenditures compared to female customers.
    
-   **Showed** that female customers have more consistent spending patterns, with a narrower purchase range, indicating less variation in their spending habits.
    
-   **Confirmed** that Walmart can leverage these insights by targeting marketing strategies toward male customers for higher average spending, while also exploring promotions to boost female customers' purchase amounts.

### About Walmart

Walmart is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of supercenters, discount departmental stores, and grocery stores from the United States. Walmart has more than 100 million customers worldwide.

  
### Business Problem

The Management team at Walmart Inc. wants to analyze the customer purchase behavior (specifically, purchase amount) against the customerâ€™s gender and the various other factors to help the business make better decisions. They want to understand if the spending habits differ between male and female customers: Do women spend more on Black Friday than men? (Assume 50 million customers are male and 50 million are female).
